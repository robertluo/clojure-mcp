(defmethod tool-system/tool-description :file-write [_]
  "Write a file to the local filesystem. Overwrites the existing file if there is one.

For Clojure files (.clj, .cljs, .cljc, .edn):
- Content will be linted for syntax errors before writing
- Content will be formatted according to Clojure standards
- Writing will fail if linting detects syntax errors

For other file types:
- Content is written directly without linting or formatting

IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE:
- If the file has been modified since it was last read, writing will fail
- You must use read_file to get the current content before editing a file
- This prevents accidental overwrites of external changes

Returns information about whether the file was created or updated, along with a diff 
showing the changes made.

Before using this tool:
1. Use the read_file tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Directory Verification (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the list_directory tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
3. For Clojure files, ensure code is syntactically correct

# Example:
# file_write(
#   file_path: \"/absolute/path/to/file.clj\",
#   content: \"(ns my.namespace)\\n\\n(defn my-function [x]\\n  (* x 2))\"
# )")
